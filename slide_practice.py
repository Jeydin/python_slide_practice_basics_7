Algorithm: Process (step-by-step) where a problem can be solved that will always give the right answer

A series of steps that solves a problem
v = 3 * 2
print(v)

1. Alarm goes off
2. Snooze alarm
3. Hopefully wake up later

Three main categories of algorithms
"The building blocks" of algorithms

Sequencing - List of steps (goes in order)
Selection - Ifs/elses (choices)
Iteration - Loops (repeating something)


Building Block #1: Sequencing
Q: What is 2 to the 5th power?
start = 2 * 2
nxt = start * 2
nxt2 = nxt * 2
ans = next2 * 2

Real World:
1. Alarm goes off
2. Smash the snoooze button
3. Back to sleep

Building Block #2: Iteration
1st = [2, 2, 2, 2]
ans = 2
for x in list:
	ans = and * x

1. For each homework problem
	- Solve problem

Building Block #3: Selection
if ans < 32:
	ans *= 2
else:
	return ans

If it is weekend, sleep in
Else, wake up early

Three types of sorting algorithms:
1. Bubble sort
2. Selection source
3. Insertion sort
